# Whole User Journey (WUJ) analysis for gov.uk

The aim of this project is to identify all of the pages relevant to a whole user journey in gov.uk. We focus on "economic recovery" use case throughout our analysis.

## Structure

In Section 1 we describe how webpages are used to construct probabilistic graph. Section 2 categorises different approaches to webpage ranking. Section 3 presents the existing approach to identifying relevant webpages, which serves as our benchmark, while Section 4 outlines methods we considered to improve upon this benchmark. Section 5 describes how named entity recognition data were obtained and Section 6 contains overview of main results.

## 1. Inputs

Starting with an expert-compiled list of webpages deemed relevant for a user journey, a probabilistic graph of gov.uk webpages is constructed. We use the existing approach to constructing such graph, which is briefly described below. For our analysis, we load a probabilistic graph already created by the DataLabs team.

Steps:
1. Start with "seed" pages identified as relevant to a given user journey.
2. Obtain pages hyperlinked from the seed pages.
3. Use BigQuery to extract user movement to and from the pages from steps (1) and (2).

Specifically, in step (3) we pick all sessions where user selects at least one webpage from steps (1) and (2) and retrieve all webpages visited during these sessions. 

Output: Probabilistic graph of pages
- All webpages that appear in the BigQuery are used as graph nodes.
- Edge weights are the probabilities of moving from one page to another (calculated using the number of such moves in step (3)).


## 2. Solution space

We can categorise solutions based on what information is used to rank webpages. In our context, this can be phrased as a question of "what makes webpages relevant to a user journey". As we chracterise the user journey by seed pages selected by an expert, this problem can be phrased as "what makes two webpages similar" (in a sense relevant to a user journey). Based on this, two main approaches (i.e. two "similarity hypotheses") can be characterised:

What makes pages / nodes similar?
- Context: pages with a similar context tend to be similar     
- Content: pages with similar content tend to be similar

### 2.1 Context-based approaches

*Hypothesis: nodes in a similar context tend to be similar*

Context can be defined in various ways. In the context considered here, this can mean, for example, that if users who visit webpage A often proceed to visiting webpage B, the webpages A and B have similar relevance to a user journey. Alternatively, webpages which appear in many user paths extracted by BigQuery can be seen as (equally) relevant to a given user path.

In the language of graphs these two cases can be can be respectively phrased as:
- Homophily: nodes that are highly connected or belong to similar clusters have similar relevance.
- Structural equivalence: nodes with similar structural roles have similar relevance.

In the figure below, the yellow node represents a seed node. Homophily hypothesis states that yellow and green nodes have similar relevance, while structural equivalence states that yellow and red nodes have similar relevance.

### Extracting context

One possibility of extracting context of a graph node (i.e. webpage) is to use random walks. Specifically, starting in a given node, say A, a subsequent node is selected from the neighbors of node A randomly. Different types of random walks exist. They differ in whether homophily or structural equivalence are assumed, and based on this the transition probabilities (i.e. probability of selecting a given neighbor of node A) are modified, in order to bias the random walks to explore the relevant part of the graph (neighborhoods under homophily, far-away nodes under structural equivalence).

### 2.2 Content-based approaches

*Hypothesis: nodes with a similar content tend to be similar*

The shortcoming of context-based approaches is that they ignore the content of webpages. Since webpages with similar content are likely to cover related topics, and thus have similar relevance to a user journey, incorporating content could be beneficial for webpage ranking. 

This approach consists of two steps:
1. Content extraction: in our case, we will extract named entities from pages.
2. Content comparison: represent the extracted content as vectors and combine them with the graph representation.

## 3. Current approach

Starting from the probabilistic graph described in Section 1, the ranking is created as follows:
 1. Run undirected random walks from seed nodes (100 walks of length 100 from each node) and record pages visited along these walks.
 2. Use "page-frequency-path-frequency" metric to rank the relevance of the pages in the journey. For a given webpage this metric combines the number of walks it occurs on and the (maximum) number of times it occurs within a single random walk. Specifically, for a given webpage, say B, PFPF score is given by

$$ \text{PFPF(B)} = \text{number of random walks page B occurs on} \times \text{max number of occarences of page B within a single random walk.} $$

The current approach is thus context-based. As this approach lets random walks wander far from the starting node, it is likely to be biased towards structural equivalence assumption (although a more detailed analysis would be needed to confirm this).

The whole existing approach, from BigQuery to final rank creation is illustrated on the figure below. In red are the part we seek to modify.

## 4. Our approach

We first consider an alternative context-only approach, based on second-order random walks (Section 4.1), introduced by Grover et al. (2016). Subsequently, we combine context and content-based approaches using graph neural networks (Section 4.2). 

A common feature of our methods is that we seek to encode graph nodes (webpages) as vectors. That is, starting from a graph, for a given node (say node u in the picture below), we seek a mapping of that node into a vector space.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71390120/184178702-f6a3e3b3-216a-4b58-a9c7-46b24b3c742e.png)

*Source: Hamilton, 2020*

This is hardly a surprising feature. Indeed, even the current method embeds nodes as vectors (specifically, each node is encoded in a vector of length 100, with elements given by the counts of the corresponding website in each random walk). What is different in our approach is that this vector is obtained as a solution to an **optimisation problem**, as opposed to a heuristic rule.

### 4.1 Context-based approaches

We modify the original procedure in three ways.
1. Introduce second-order random walks.
2. Vector embeddings are a solution to an optimisation problem.
3. Cosine simularity is used as a similarity metric.

Overall this corresponds to Node2vec (Grover et al, 2016). 

The second-order random walks modify the way in which context is sampled. By selecting hyperparameters, second-order random walks can focus on exploring starting node's neighbours (graph "breadth") or wander far from the starting node (exploring the network "depth"), and to interpolate between these two approaches. 

<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71390120/184365359-5858f189-d939-458c-a1c3-b79f88e37bd3.png width=40% height=40%>

In the first step, we only modify random walks and leave the original PFPF ranking method intact. In the second step we implement the full Node2vec procedure, that is second-rder random walks together with new node embeddings and a new ranking metric.

In order to compare the three methods (original, 2nd order RWs + PFPF metric, and Node2vec) we run the original rnaking procedure (with a random seed) and manually label top 100 pages as either relevant or irrelevant to a user journey.

We evaluate the three methods using the following score (*higher score = better*)

$$ \frac{ \text{median(irrelevant)} - \text{median(relevant)} }{ \sigma( \text{irrelevant} ) + \sigma( \text{relevant} ) } $$

where "relevant" is a ranking (top = 1, bottom = 100) of pages labelled as relevant to a user journey, and similarly for "irrelevant" , and $ \sigma $ is a standard deviation.

The original method achieves score of around 0, while the 2nd order RWs + PFPF metric achieves a score of 0.22 and Node2vec achieves the score of 0.24 (the latter two averaged over multiple initialisation and hyperparameter choices).

Crucially, the higher score rely on breadth-first search, that is on random walks exploring starting node's neighborhood first (the green arrows in the figure above).
We will make use of this observation when formulating unsupervised approaches combining node context and content.

#### Shortcomings of context-based approaches

It is widely recognised that methods such as Node2vec suffer from a number of drawbacks. In our setting the most relevant one are:
1. Methods are not applicable to unseen nodes: If the BigQuery is ran over a different time period (e.g. more recent), new webpages (i.e. new nodes) are likely to be present. The random-walk based approaches discussed here cannot calculate ranking for such new nodes and the whole procedure needs to be re-fitted.
2. These methods don't consider node features, e.g. the content of webpages. The ranking is thus based purely on the node context, i.e. on the user movement between webpages.

### 4.2 Context and content-based approaches

We now seek to combine both webpage context within the graph and content to create a ranking. We will do this using a framework of graph neural networks (GNNs).

GNNs are based on an idea of message passing, where node features are updated to incorporate features of the neighboring nodes. Consider a simple directed graph in the figure below.

In the first stage of message passing, each node aggregates the features of the neighboring nodes. For example, the blue node aggregates node features of its neighbors (in green). Likewise, each of green nodes aggregatse features of its neighbors (in yellow). As a result, we obtain a new graph (on the right), with the same structure but different node features. The blue node will now contain a combination of its own features and features of green nodes (hence the node is two-coloured now), etc.
This corresponds to a one-layer GNN (a two-layer GNN would repeat the same step of feature aggregation on the graph obtained from the first layer). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71390120/184371924-ae5338e4-f90e-49ec-99be-6ee32a49032a.png)

There are various ways we can combine the features of node's neighbors with its own features, and this results in different GNN architectures. Once the architecture is selected, the parameters are optimised in the usual way, as a function minimisation. The objective function that is minimised is another crucial difference between different GNN methods.

Throughout our analysis we keep the architecture fixed and use convolutional GNNs (Reference XXXX). We consider two approaches:
1. Semi-supervised: we manually label part of the nodes and train GNN to solve a classification problem using this subset of nodes.
2. Unsupervised

#### Semi-supervised approach

#### Unsupervised approach

An unsupervised GNN can be thought of as an encoder-decoder model. Encoder embeds graph nodes into a vector space (as described above). Then, a decoder uses vector embeddings to reconstruct a certain property of the nodes. That is, starting from vector embeddings decoder aims to recontsruct a certain statistic of the nodes. The figure below illustrates this.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71390120/184417829-5ab58787-862e-454d-9959-9447bbb86433.png)

*Source: Hamilton, 2020*

Unsupervised GNN models differ in the construction of the encoder and the statistic that the model is aiming to reconstruct. The statistic is chosen so that the model suits the application at hand.

Our choice of statistics has been motivated by the encouraging results of Node2Vec described earlier. Specifically, we aim to maximise the probability of observing node's neighbors given node's embedding. As this objective function is infeasible to calculate, we use second order random walks for negative sampling, as in Node2Vec. As an encoder, we use a two-layer convolutional GNN. Also in a direct analogy with Node2vec, we use cosine distance as a ranking metric.





We tried various approaches to this problem. They can all be seen as a successive modification of the curent approach.

1. Replace random walks in the original approach by second-order random walks
2. 

The current approach utilises random walks which begin from a small set of seed nodes in an undirected graph. The "page-frequency-path-frequency" metric is utilised to rank the relevance of the pages in the journey. 

We proposed a number of changes to this approach:
- Use a directed graph, rather than an undirected graph
- Utilise biased random walks (homophily vs equivariance)
- Utilise Word2Vec embedding
- Extract named-entities from gov.uk pages to enrich the nodes with metadata
- Use graph neural networks to improve the edge-level predictions

### Performance metric

To compare different ranking algorithms we use the following performance measure.

For a single run of the original ranking algorithm, we produce a list of top 100 pages. These are manually labelled (1 = relevant, 0 = irrelevant) and used for algorithm evaluation ("evaluation set") using the following metric:

$$ \text{score} = \frac{ \text{median}(relevant) - \text{median}(irrelevant)}{ \sigma(relevant) + \sigma(irrelevant) }, $$

where $ relevant $ and $ irrelevant $ are rankings of evaluation set pages labelled 1 and 0 respectively, and $ \sigma $ is a standard deviation.

All of the apporaches discussed here involve some randomness, predominantly coming from random walks. For this reason, scores given below are averaged over multiple runs (usually 10 or 20) of the same method for the same combination of hyperparameters. 

### Evaluation of proposed changes

To choose which of the proposed steps has positive impact on rankings we ran the following ranking algorithms.

1. **Biased random walks**: Use biased RWs (from the same seeds, using the same walk length, and the same ranking metric (pfpf)). This measures proposed changes 1 & 2.
2. **Biased random walks & vector embeddings**: Use N2V embedding to vector space. Metric is a simple L2 norm distance from the same seeds as original ranking procedure.
3. **Biased random walks & vector embeddings & W2V scores** (this corresponds to Node2Vec approach).

The original apporach (undirected graph, unbiased RWs, pfpf score) gives a score of close to zero (with a meaon of **-0.016** and standard deviation 0.033). This constitutes our benchmark.

The scores for different parameter combinations for the three methods can be found below. While certain parameter combinations are far from ideal (or sensible), the overall improvement in scores is evident.

Overall our preliminary results indicate that performance can be improved by:
1. Considering directed graph.
2. Using biased random walks.
3. Embedding nodes in vector space, especially if an apporpriate loss function is used.

### Further analysis

The embedding in vector space gives us an opportunity to explore the whole network, in relation to the set of seed pages or economic recovery pages.

In particular, vector embeddings can be analysed by clustering methods and dimensionality reduction techniques which enable visual analysis.

To this end, consider mapping graph nodes to a 10-dimensional vector space and using TSNE to reduce the result to two dimensions. In the plot below the axis correspond to TSNE variables and orange dots are economic recovery pages.

While not particularly beautiful, the economic recovery pages seem to exhibit a cluster structure. The TSNE mapping is highly random, and, over repeated replications, only two (rather than three as this plot may suggest) major clusters of ER pages seems to appear regularly - and these are mosttly visible along the y-axis.

![tsne](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71390120/173683883-d97ea3f6-696b-43a8-b490-a95262816303.png)

This encouraged us to look further. We use K-means clustering on a 10-dimensional vector space for this purpose.

The numer of clusters is chosen using the sum of squared distances from cluster centres (see the plot below). Base don this metric we opt for 8 clusters.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71390120/173684277-113f9186-ddc7-4022-a868-0ad96da0ce27.png)

Interestingly, most of ER pages (33 out of 40) fall into two clusters, supporting the results of TSNE analysis.

The plot below illustrates the connections between ER pages, with pages colored by cluster (2 pages were omitted as distort the plot). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71390120/173689496-61414ecb-492a-45cb-a18e-00ad74b6b8dd.png)


It appears that the first cluster (purple) relates to a large extent to education, as it include sfor exmaple pages like:
/topic/further-education-skills/apprenticeships
/browse/working/finding-job
/become-apprentice
/browse/education/find-course
/become-apprentice/apply-for-an-apprenticeship
/find-traineeship
/browse/education

The second cluster (orange), on the other hand relates to more general queries, in particular claiming benefits.


## Named-entity recognition 
To enrich the nodes (webpages) from gov.uk with features prior to implementing GNNs, inference was performed from a previously created Named-Entity Recognition (NER) model which utilises the DistillBERT architecture (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108). This model can be used to highlight named-entities in a number of categories (e.g., organisation, people) which can be visualisd as follows:

The NER script in this repo can be used to output data into a .csv file in the following format:

## Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
The plan is to experiment with a number of GNN architectures (e.g., GAT, Hyperbolic GCN) to make edge level predictions.
